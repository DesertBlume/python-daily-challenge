Built three classes: one parent class and two child classes. Each child added its own unique method, and I practiced overriding a method inherited from the parent. I also got different class instances to interact — a first small step toward more complex behavior.

* Worked on basic loops with `try-except` blocks. Learned that using `continue` inside an exception handler can reset the loop properly.
* Practiced calling class methods and attributes from outside the class:

  * Use the object’s name instead of `self` (e.g., `fighter.fight()` instead of `self.fight()`).
  * Same applies to attributes (`fighter.hp`, `fighter.name`).
* Learned how to use `python3 -m` to run a module that’s not in the current directory.
* Gained a surface-level understanding of the role of `__init__.py` for treating folders as packages.
* As a bonus, experimented with creating a simple plugin for Neovim.

## Current Goal

Expand the parent class logic so that if certain conditions are met, an instance can deactivate itself and refuse to run its methods until something external reactivates it. I’m using fantasy elements to keep it fun and to inch closer to finally building that video game I’ve always dreamed about.
