# Daily-Challenge

The **Daily-Challenge** series is entirely my own work, created to sharpen my technical skills through daily, hands-on practice. While many of my earlier projects used generative AI for assistance, the ideas, troubleshooting, and effort were always my own — and that helped me build a broad understanding of different tools and languages.

Now that I see the bigger picture, this repo is about focusing on the details — tackling small, practical coding tasks every day. I break down concepts, experiment with Python basics, push my understanding of loops, classes, modules, and plugins, and keep track of what I learn like a technical journal. This is where I test myself and build the habits that will make me a better developer.
