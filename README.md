# Daily-Challenge

The **Daily-Challenge** series is entirely my own work, created to sharpen my technical skills through consistent practice. While many of my earlier workflows in other repos were built with substantial help from generative AI, the core ideas, troubleshooting, and persistence were all mine — and that gave me a broad perspective on various tools and languages. Now that I can see the whole forest, this repo is about studying each individual tree.

## June 28th, 2025

Built three classes: one parent class and two child classes. Each child added its own unique method, and I practiced overriding a method inherited from the parent. I also got different class instances to interact — a first small step toward more complex behavior.

## Current Goal

Expand the parent class logic so that if certain conditions are met, an instance can deactivate itself and refuse to run its methods until something external reactivates it. I’m using fantasy elements to keep it fun and to inch closer to finally building that video game I’ve always dreamed about.
